<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initiated a series of design and content updates for the DigiHome property management website. The primary focus of the recent requests has been to translate the entire website from English to Norwegian, ensuring the language sounds natural and not AI-generated. This includes updating all sections, from the hero text to the footer. Additionally, the user has provided specific feedback on various sections, requesting UI/UX improvements such as redesigning the How It Works and Results sections, making the site fully mobile-responsive, adding a pricing section, creating an investor subpage, and updating images and layouts for a more polished, minimalistic aesthetic. An unresolved issue remains with the owner portal creation flow, where the UI snaps back on error instead of providing clear feedback.

**User's preferred language**: Norwegian. The user is providing instructions in both English and Norwegian, but the core task is a full Norwegian localization. All new communication should be in natural-sounding Norwegian.

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack web application for DigiHome, a property management service.
-   **Frontend**: A responsive React application built with Tailwind CSS. It features a multi-section landing page (, , , , , , , , , etc.), a multi-step lead generation form, and an .
-   **Backend**: A FastAPI application connected to a MongoDB database, providing endpoints for lead submission () and owner registration ().
-   **Localization**: The site has been partially translated into Norwegian, but several key components and strings remain in English.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was performing a comprehensive translation of the entire website to Norwegian, as requested by the user. The agent had identified several components with remaining English text (, , , , ) and was in the process of translating them sequentially. The last completed action was translating the .
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Manual testing via the screenshot tool is required to visually inspect every page and component to ensure all text is translated correctly and that layouts are not broken. Afterwards, a run with the frontend testing agent can verify that no functionality was broken.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: Complete the full-site translation to Norwegian (P0)
-   Issue 2: The owner portal creation flow snaps back on error (P1)

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Complete the full-site translation to Norwegian**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent has successfully translated many sections, including , , , , and . However, a final, full-site review is pending.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Systematically view every component file in .
        2.  Check for any hardcoded English strings in component JSX, placeholders, button text, error messages, etc.
        3.  Pay special attention to , , and  as they might have been overlooked.
        4.  Translate all remaining English text to natural-sounding Norwegian.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To fulfill the user's primary request for a fully localized Norwegian website.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

-   **Issue 2: The owner portal creation flow snaps back on error**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The user reported that clicking Create Owner Portal fails silently and snaps back to the form. The  identified that the frontend was not properly handling HTTP 400 errors (e.g., Owner already exists) from the backend because  doesn't throw an error for it. The agent implemented a fix in  to explicitly check .
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  The fix has not been verified by the user. The agent pivoted to other UI tasks before confirmation.
        2.  Manually test the Create Owner Portal flow with an email that already exists in the database.
        3.  Verify that the new error message (Owner portal already exists for this email) is displayed to the user correctly.
        4.  Ensure the form state is handled gracefully on error.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This will fix a critical bug in the user onboarding funnel, providing clear feedback and preventing user confusion.
    -   **Status**: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both (to confirm API response and frontend handling)
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Full Norwegian Localization**
    -   **Where to resume**: The agent has just translated . The next step is to conduct a final, exhaustive review of all components (especially , , and ) to find and translate any remaining English text.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: A complete, professional, and fully Norwegian website.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something**: None

-   **Broken**: The owner portal creation flow has a known UX bug where it snaps back on error without clear user feedback. This needs verification.
-   **Mocked**: None.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES (Backend was tested once; Frontend was tested once, but many changes have occurred since).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: YES (Used to diagnose the owner portal creation error).
-   **Test files created**:  was created by the testing agent.
-   **Known regressions**: None explicitly known, but the Owner Portal flow needs re-testing.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   No credentials required.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent did not forget but was interrupted mid-task. The full site translation needs to be completed and verified.
-   Crucially, the agent did not circle back to confirm with the user that the owner portal creation bug was fixed after implementing the  status check. The task was marked as done by the agent but never verified by the user, who immediately pivoted to other UI requests.</analysis>
