The AI engineer successfully built a pixel-perfect frontend clone of  initially, then iteratively transformed it into the DigiHome property management application based on continuous user feedback. The process involved creating multiple React components for various sections (Navbar, Hero, Lead Generation, About, How It Works, Results, Presence, Expansion, Benefits, Professional Services). Extensive design refinements were made, including logo sizing, text changes, background image updates, responsive positioning, and complete redesigns of several sections to match new visual inspirations and content requirements. A multi-step onboarding flow with lead generation and owner portal creation was implemented in the frontend. Most recently, backend components for lead and owner management were created using FastAPI and MongoDB, and integrated with the frontend. However, the initial backend testing attempt resulted in an error, indicating a pending task for debugging and successful backend verification. The UI is highly dynamic and responsive, with several interactive elements.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a pixel-perfect clone of , focusing only on the identical navbar and two sections (hero and one other, matching design, layout, colors, fonts, images, animations, and structure). This was to be a frontend-only implementation with mock data.

**Current Product State:**
The application is a frontend-heavy MVP for DigiHome, a property management company. It features a responsive, modern design with a refined navigation bar. Key sections include:
-   **Hero Section**: Dynamic background image, prominent main heading (Let go of your rental headaches) and subtitle (DigiHome delivers data-driven property management with human service), and a Get started call-to-action button. The hero text and image are responsively positioned.
-   **Lead Generation Block**: An interactive form that starts as a single Address input and expands to a 2x2 layout (Address, Name, Phone, Email) upon user interaction. It includes a Calculate my earnings button.
-   **Owner Onboarding Flow**: After Calculate my earnings, transitions to Create Your Owner Portal with a password field. Create Owner Portal button triggers a loading animation, then displays Owner portal created with a Go to Owner Portal button.
-   **What We Are Section**: Explains DigiHome's core identity, featuring a background image and a prominent content card with details on Airbnb and long-term rental management.
-   **How It Works Section**: A vertical timeline illustrating DigiHome's efficient, digital onboarding and local service delivery.
-   **Results From Real Properties Section**: Showcases anonymized property results (e.g., increased rent, less time spent on management) in a card-on-image layout with a background image.
-   **Professional Services (DigiHome Ecosystem)**: A carousel section highlighting partner services (cleaners, maintenance, security) with image-filled cards and a clear value proposition.
-   **Our Presence Section**: Details DigiHome's geographical presence in Norway and internationally, presented in a card-on-image layout.
-   **Expansion Markets Section**: Describes DigiHome's launch in new European markets (Netherlands, Germany, France, Finland) with a Join as Pioneer CTA.
-   **Pioneer Benefits Section**: Lists benefits for early adopters (discounts, priority support, founding member status, input on service).

The application uses an integrated React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on updating the design of the Our Presence section. The user requested to change the Our Presence section to be a list, similar to the Results section (which uses a card-on-image layout). The AI engineer confirmed this and then successfully executed the edit.

The previous actions also involved:
1.  Redesigning the Results from Real Properties section to a card-on-image layout with content on the right, updated text, and a new background image.
2.  Creating and refining the Professional Services section as a carousel with image-filled cards, adjusting their size and ensuring the text hierarchy was correct.
3.  Implementing the backend for the owner onboarding flow, which involved creating new Pydantic models (, ) and FastAPI routes (, ), and integrating them into .
4.  Updating the frontend's  to interact with these new backend APIs and to display form errors.
5.  Restarting the backend service and attempting to test the new backend routes using , which unfortunately failed.

The current state of the application's UI is highly refined, with all requested sections implemented and styled according to the user's detailed design instructions. The frontend onboarding flow is complete with multi-step animations, and the backend infrastructure for it is in place, awaiting successful testing.
